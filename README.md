# Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualization

An interactive web application that visualizes Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. This tool helps users understand how the algorithm explores nodes and determines the shortest path in a weighted graph.

**Live Demo:** [Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualization](https://alexmosiakin.github.io/dijkstra/)

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Graph Creation:** Users can add nodes and edges to construct custom graphs.
- **Algorithm Visualization:** Step-by-step animation of Dijkstra's algorithm, highlighting the current node, updating distances, and showing the shortest path.
- **Customizable Weights:** Allows users to assign weights to edges to see how different weights affect the shortest path.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures optimal viewing experience across various devices.
